# AI-Based Customer Churn Prediction for Telco

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the project employs various AI techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict churn.

## Project Overview

- **Data Acquisition:** Description of the process for downloading the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Detailed steps on handling null values, duplicates, and data type conversions, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis to understand customer demographics, service usage, and churn rates, with visualizations to highlight key findings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explanation of the process for selecting and transforming features for the predictive model.
- **Model Development:** Description of building sequential models using Keras, including the architecture, activation functions, optimization algorithms, and the rationale behind the choices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Discussion on the evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and accuracy vs. epochs graphs to assess model performance.

## Key Findings
